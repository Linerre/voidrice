# My Linux/Unix Ricing

The repo name is forked from [Luke Smith's voidrice](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice), but the configurations are quite different.

This repo contains my dotfiles for the following \*nix systems:
1. Arch Linux (Thinkpad T490)
2. Gentoo Linux (PC: AMD 4800H + 64GB RAM + 500GB NVME SSD)
2. Gentoo Linux (PC: AMD 4750G + 64GB RAM + 500GB NVME SSD)
4. FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Void Linux (QEMU/KVM)

It is for this reason that quite a few **if** blocks spread throught some configs.

Also, I'm using both Vim and Emacs, both dwm and bspwm, both bash and zsh.
