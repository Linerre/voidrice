The repo name is forked from [Luke Smith's voidrice](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice), but the configurations are quite different.

NOTE: I'm migrating my configs to Nix home-manager and will not update whatever is here anymore.

Credit: Void Linux was once running on one of my machines as my daily driver. But lacking of a nearby mirror was giving me hard times and caused me to give up. These days I find there are several mirrors already set up and I'm considering restoring it in a virtual machine.
