# My Linux/Unix Ricing

## Name Origin
The repo name is forked from [Luke Smith's voidrice](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice), but the configurations are quite different.

## Scope
This repo contains my dotfiles for the following \*nix systems:
1. Arch Linux (Thinkpad T490)
2. macOS (M1 Macbook Air 2020)
3. Gentoo Linux (PC: AMD 4800H + 64GB RAM + 500GB NVME SSD)
4. Gentoo Linux (PC: AMD 4750G + 64GB RAM + 500GB NVME SSD)
5. FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Void Linux (QEMU/KVM)

It is for this reason that quite a few **if** blocks spread throught some configs.

Also, I'm using both Vim and Emacs, both dwm and bspwm, both bash and zsh.

## Submodules
Currently vim and neovim configs are [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). I found they are too extensible, constantly under development or modification, to be included here as other configs which will only be modified from time to time.

I'm considering making emacs config a submodule too should the need arise.
