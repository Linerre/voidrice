The repo name is forked from [Luke Smith's voidrice](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice), but the configurations are quite different.

Depite the name, the dotfiles are now used on my two Gentoo machines:
1. AMD 4750G with 64GB RAM and 512GB NVME SSD
2. AMD 5950X with 128GB RAM and 512 NVME SSD, plus AMD Raedon 550X Graphics Card

The Gentoo-specific config is in a separate repo: https://github.com/Linerre/portage.d

Credit: Void Linux was once running on one of my machines as my daily driver. But lacking of a nearby mirror was giving me hard times and caused me to give up. These days I find there are several mirrors already set up and I'm considering restoring it in a virtual machine.
